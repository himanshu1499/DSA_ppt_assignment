    "The key steps involved in training and validating machine learning models can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Preparation: This step involves gathering and preparing the data for model training and validation. It includes tasks such as data cleaning, handling missing values, data normalization or scaling, and splitting the data into training and validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model Selection: In this step, you choose the appropriate type of machine learning model for your problem, considering factors such as the nature of the data, the target variable (classification, regression, etc.), and the available resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature Selection/Engineering: Feature selection involves identifying the most relevant features from the dataset that will be used as inputs for the model. Feature engineering refers to creating new features or transforming existing features to enhance the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model Training: This step involves feeding the prepared training data into the chosen machine learning model. The model learns from the input data and adjusts its internal parameters to minimize the difference between the predicted outputs and the actual outputs. This optimization process is typically done using algorithms such as gradient descent or backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Model Evaluation: Once the model is trained, it needs to be evaluated to assess its performance.
